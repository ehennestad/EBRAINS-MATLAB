classdef (Abstract) BaseClient < handle & matlab.mixin.CustomDisplay
    % BASECLIENT Base class for RESTful ebrains.collaboratory services.
    % Includes common initialization and authentication code. Authentication
    % code may have to be manually updated after code generation.
    %
    % This class cannot be instantiated directly, work with classes derived
    % from it to actually interact with the RESTful service.

        % Cookie jar. The cookie jar is shared across all Api classes in the 
        % same package. All responses are automatically parsed for Set-Cookie
        % headers and cookies are automatically added to the jar. Similarly
        % cookies are added to outgoing requests if there are matching cookies 
        % in the jar for the given request. Cookies can also be added manually
        % by calling the setCookies method on the cookies property. The cookie
        % jar is also saved to disk (cookies.mat in the same directory as 
        % BaseClient) and reloaded in new MATLAB sessions.
